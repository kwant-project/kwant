We provide Kwant as free software under a :doc:`BSD license <license>` as a
service to the physics community.  If you have used Kwant for work that has lead
to a scientific publication, please mention this explicitly in the text body.
In addition, we ask you to cite the main paper that introduces Kwant:

  TO-BE-FILLED-IN

If you have profited from the quantum transport functionality of Kwant, please
also cite the upcoming paper that describes the relevant algorithms. The
reference will be added to this document later, and will also be available at
`<http://kwant-project.org/citing.html>`_.

Kwant owes much of its current performance to the use of the `MUMPS
<http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS/>`_ library for solving systems of sparse linear
equations.  If you have done high-performance calculations, we suggest citing

  P. R. Amestoy, I. S. Duff, J. S. Koster, J. Y. L’Excellent, SIAM. J. Matrix
  Anal. & Appl. **23** (1), 15 (2001).

Finally, if you use the routine for generation of circular ensembles of random
matrices, please cite
