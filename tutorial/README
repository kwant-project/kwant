This directory contains the example scripts of the tutorial.


Note for kwant developers
-------------------------

Say you have modified SCRIPT.py in this directory.  Make sure that the tutorial
image generation patches still apply by deleting doc/source/images/SCRIPT.py
and running ``make doc/source/images/SCRIPT.py`` in doc.  Now examine the newly
created doc/source/images/SCRIPT.py.  If you do not like the result or the
patch did not apply, edit doc/source/images/SCRIPT.py until you like it.  You
can run `make html` during your edits to check things.  Finally, even if you
did not edit the script, execute generate-diffs.sh in doc/source/images.  If
the patches applied cleanly the diff files will usually stay unchanged.
